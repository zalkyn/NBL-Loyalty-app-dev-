/**
 * @file jobs/jobCleanupJob.js
 * @description Periodically deletes old COMPLETED jobs from the Job table
 * to keep it from growing unbounded.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — retention window:
 * `idempotencyKey` on the Job model is what prevents duplicate processing
 * of a re-delivered Shopify webhook (Shopify guarantees at-least-once
 * delivery, and merchants can also manually resend a webhook from the
 * admin days after the fact). Deleting a COMPLETED job's row removes that
 * protection for that specific job. RETENTION_DAYS must stay comfortably
 * longer than any realistic re-delivery window — do not lower this below
 * ~30 days without a specific reason.
 *
 * Only ever touches status = "COMPLETED". FAILED / CANCELLED / PENDING /
 * PROCESSING rows are never deleted here — FAILED rows in particular need
 * to stay visible in the admin Jobs UI until a human (or the auto-retry
 * job) resolves them.
