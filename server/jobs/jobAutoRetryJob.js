/**
 * @file jobs/jobAutoRetryJob.js
 * @description Periodically re-queues FAILED jobs whose last error looks
 * transient (network-related), so a temporary Shopify API blip doesn't
 * require manual intervention.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow scope — this is NOT a blanket "retry everything that
 * failed" job. A job only reaches FAILED after exhausting its normal
 * in-cycle retries (see processJob() in orderPaidJob.js etc. — exponential
 * backoff across maxAttempts). If it's still failing after that, it's
 * more likely a real/structural problem (bad payload, a code bug, a
 * deleted Shopify resource) than a network hiccup — those should surface
 * in the admin Jobs UI for a human to look at, not get silently retried
 * on a loop forever.
 *
 * So this job only revives a FAILED job when BOTH are true:
 *   1. lastError matches one of TRANSIENT_ERROR_PATTERNS
 *   2. autoRetryCount < AUTO_RETRY_CAP (each revival increments this)
 *
 * Anything else — including jobs that exhaust AUTO_RETRY_CAP — stays
 * FAILED and shows up in the admin Jobs UI for manual retry/review.
